### Can I analyze private Instagram profiles?
No, our tool only works with public profiles. Private accounts cannot be analyzed without following them.

### How accurate is the data?
Our data comes directly from Instagram's public API and is updated in real-time. It's as accurate as Instagram's publicly displayed metrics.

### How often should I analyze a profile?
For ongoing monitoring, analyze weekly or bi-weekly. For one-time vetting (like influencer partnerships), once is usually sufficient.

### Can I analyze my own profile?
Yes! It's a great way to benchmark your performance and track improvement over time.

### Can I export the data?

### Why is engagement rate more important than follower count?
A smaller, highly engaged audience is more valuable than a large, passive audience. Engagement rate shows actual influence and content quality.

## Best Practices for Instagram Analysis

### For Brands

1. **Analyze Multiple Competitors**
   - Don't rely on a single data point
   - Look for patterns across 10+ profiles
   
2. **Check Recent Performance**
   - Look at last 12 posts, not just averages
   - Recent drops could indicate bought followers wearing off

3. **Cross-Reference with Other Tools**
   - Use multiple data sources when possible
   - Verify suspicious metrics

4. **Consider Niche Context**
   - Tech accounts naturally have lower engagement
   - Beauty accounts typically have higher rates

### For Creators

1. **Track Your Progress**
   - Analyze yourself monthly
   - Document what strategies work

2. **Study Top Performers**
   - What content do they post?
   - When do they post?
   - How do they engage?

3. **Don't Obsess Over Numbers**
   - Quality > quantity always
   - Authentic engagement matters most

4. **Use Data to Improve**
   - Test different content types
   - Optimize posting times
   - Engage more with followers

## Advanced Analysis Tips

### Spotting Bought Engagement

1. **Comment Quality Check**
   - Read through comments
   - Look for generic "Nice!" "Love!" patterns
   - Check if comments relate to content

2. **Follower Analysis**
   - Click through some followers
   - Real accounts have posts and followers
   - Bots often have no posts or few followers

3. **Engagement Velocity**
   - Real posts gain engagement gradually
   - Botted posts spike immediately then plateau

4. **Story Views vs Feed Engagement**
   - Stories typically get 5-20% of follower count
   - Low story views + high post likes = suspicious

### Calculating Influencer ROI

**Formula:**
```
ROI = (Revenue from Campaign - Campaign Cost) / Campaign Cost × 100
```

**Example:**
- Influencer cost: PKR 20,000
- Generated sales: PKR 100,000
- Profit margin: 40% = PKR 40,000
- ROI = (40,000 - 20,000) / 20,000 × 100 = **100% ROI**
